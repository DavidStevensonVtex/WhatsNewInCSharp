The 6.0 release of C# contained many features that improve productivity for developers. Features in this release include:

Read-only Auto-properties:
You can create read-only auto-properties that can be set only in constructors.
Auto-Property Initializers:
You can write initialization expressions to set the initial value of an auto-property.
Expression-bodied function members:
You can author one-line methods using lambda expressions.
using static:
You can import all the methods of a single class into the current namespace.
Null - conditional operators:
You can concisely and safely access members of an object while still checking for null with the null conditional operator.
String Interpolation:
You can write string formatting expressions using inline expressions instead of positional arguments.
Exception filters:
You can catch expressions based on properties of the exception or other program state.
nameof Expressions:
You can let the compiler generate string representations of symbols.
await in catch and finally blocks:
You can use await expressions in locations that previously disallowed them.
index initializers:
You can author initialization expressions for associative containers as well as sequence containers.
Extension methods for collection initializers:
Collection initializers can rely on accessible extension methods, in addition to member methods.
Improved overload resolution:
Some constructs that previously generated ambiguous method calls now resolve correctly.
