C# 7.1 is the first point release to the C# language. It marks an increased release cadence for the language. You can use the new features sooner, ideally when each new feature is ready. C# 7.1 adds the ability to configure the compiler to match a specified version of the language. That enables you to separate the decision to upgrade tools from the decision to upgrade language versions.

C# 7.1 adds the language version selection configuration element, three new language features and new compiler behavior.

The new language features in this release are:

async Main method
The entry point for an application can have the async modifier.
default literal expressions
You can use default literal expressions in default value expressions when the target type can be inferred.
Inferred tuple element names
The names of tuple elements can be inferred from tuple initialization in many cases.
Finally, the compiler has two options /refout and /refonly that control reference assembly generation.
